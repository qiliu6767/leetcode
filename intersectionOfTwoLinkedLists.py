        Write a program to find the node at which the intersection of two singly linked lists begins.
		For example, the following two linked lists:

		A:        a1 → a2
                   		↘
                     	  c1 → c2 → c3
                   		↗            
		B:   b1 → b2 → b3
		begin to intersect at node c1.
